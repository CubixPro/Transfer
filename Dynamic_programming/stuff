dude see, you don't get it. You drink with your friends and smoke pot and you like doing that. That's your outlook 
but you won't get to do them with me. Won't you be happier if you got a girl who enjoys them? I mean the way this 
is going, its not going to end well. Because we are not compatible are we. Imagine if we fell in love, and then 
we realized this is all wrong and tahole shit is going to end even worse. Otai bolchhi - we are not even 20 
and I think there are (maybe not better) but people more suited to us than we are.
